<h1> <bold> "So a lie told a million times becomes the truth" </bold> </h1>
â€”Maria Ressa, Rappler CEO, Nobel Prize winner

<p> Journalists and activists stage a protest calling to defend press freedom on January 19, 2018, in suburban Quezon City in Metro Manila, Philippines. The Philippine government had recently ordered the closure of an independent online news site, Rappler, which had been critical of President Rodrigo Duterte's administration, citing an irregularity in its incorporation papers. Many likened the move to the late Philippines dictator Ferdinand Marcos' order to close down newspapers and television networks, as well as arresting journalists critical of his administration.
